# new Text Server Client
# the client will be a GUI, opening on a screen that asks for an IP and a port
# once both values are propigated the next screen will ask for a username and password
# once values are propigated a new window will open displaying main chat
# see draw.io diagram for more info

import tkinter as tk

# initialise GUI
# have a loop in background (could use tkinters "after" method or threading?) to get messages from the server
# keep track of different chat windows and who is online?
